# tid
tid (terminal image display) is a go library for printing images to the terminal.

## Example

The images are printed using characters in the terminal, so the resolution of the printed image depends on the size of your font, as shown below:

The source image:  
![Source](static/goodfella.jpg)

With a large font (low resolution):  
![Printed - small](static/small_printed.png)

With a small font (high resolution):  
![Printed - large](static/large_printed.png)
